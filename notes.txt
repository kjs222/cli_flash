Steps needed to run program without needing to prepend ruby and path to file

1.  tell shell what interpreter to use: #!/usr/bin/env ruby   -- in bin/quizlet file
2.  make the file executable:  chmod +x bin/quizlet  -- from command line
3.  add scipt to shell's lookup path:  export PATH=/Users/seacreature/devel/rcat/bin:$PATH  -- from command line

INSTEAD OF #3 - I DID:
location:  /Users/kerrysheldon/turing/3module/projects/cli_flash/bin/quizlet
#
# type pwd:
# /Users/kerrysheldon/turing/3module/projects/cli_flash
#
#
# ln -s /Users/kerrysheldon/turing/3module/projects/cli_flash/bin/quizlet /usr/local/bin/quizlet



QUESTIONS:
*  How can I make the above steps happen more automatically for a future user
